#  Brute-Force Attack Project Using Burp Suite & Hydra

This repository contains the complete implementation of a **Brute-Force Attack Demonstration** performed on the **bWAPP (Buggy Web Application)** using two major penetration testing tools:

- **Burp Suite Intruder**
- **Hydra (THC Hydra)**

The project was executed in a **safe, controlled environment** using **Kali Linux**, XAMPP, and a local installation of bWAPP.  
This repository serves as evidence of practical cybersecurity work performed during the **Inlign Internship**.

##  Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:

- Understand how brute-force attacks work  
- Intercept login requests using Burp Suite  
- Perform Cluster Bomb brute‐force attack using Intruder  
- Automate login cracking using Hydra  
- Analyze server responses and identify valid credentials  
- Provide mitigation measures against brute-force attacks  

This project **does NOT target any live website**, only a local vulnerable test environment.
